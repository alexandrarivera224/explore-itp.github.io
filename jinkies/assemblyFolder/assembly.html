                       This lightning window is the aggregated work of the whole team. It is filled with tricks and gags that will make a thunder storm experience that people will ne-v-er for-get! The rattling effect, stained glass, rain illusion, and lightning strikes have been improved after receiving feedback in the concept refinement stage. In addition to those, we added a creepy shadow effect to further contribute to a mysterious atmosphere.

                                    A scaled down window was created to demonstrate the concept. The depth should be restricted so that the window can be easily fitted into a wall.

Crown moulding and lace curtains were added to further suggest a Victorian aesthetic. The framing behind the window was used for mounting mechanical and electrical components for the gag.

                                 Thunder sounds from the speaker system were synchronized with flashes of the high-power LEDs to simulate a lightning storm.  Parchment paper with layered cut-outs were used to diffuse the light, generate shadows, and provide the illusion of depth.
