						The last element we added was the hand paired with the ultrasonic sensor. We wanted an interactive and dynamic element to shock users, and came up with the idea of having a hand smack the window when the presence of viewers is sensed. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class = "content">
                        The ultrasonic sensor is hidden behind a black cloth in the radiator pattern. It works by sending out a 42 kHz beam and detects the reflection. If somebody is detected, the hand will be triggered. However, time delays between the triggers and a low yield random function modifier ensure that the gag is not perceived as a "cause and effect". 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class = "content">
						We made the hand by tracing Eesh's hand on blue foam and cutting it out. The edges were sanded to provide a more organic appearance. The hand was attached at an angle to a servo motor, which was actuated by a Raspberry Pi to swing towards the window and then retreat. The sound of a smack is played through the speaker in synchronization with the forward motion. Note that the hand actually does not touch the window, otherwise it would interfere with the moving rain track. A video of the effect and the "behind-the-scenes" is shown below.
