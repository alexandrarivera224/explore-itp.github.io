						There is no thunderstorm without the storm, so after the lightning and the thunder effect, we focused on making the rain and wind effect. Since we imagine this gag to be an enclosed system that is installed in the wall, we decided against using water to prevent damage to wooden components, reduce corrosion, and avoid interference with electronics. Therefore, we used hot glue to give the (really convicing) illusion of static raindrops on the window. Feedback from users and client at the sketch-concept stage indicated that we needed a more dynamic rain illusion.

                    <p class = "content">
						To simulate rain-drops sliding down a window, we constructed a transparent track and covered it with hot-glue streaks. This track was pulled using a conveyor system behind static globular rain drops placed behind the window pane. Coupled with the wind and rain sound effects, this illusion was found to be convincing to the viewers. An unexpected effect of using a thin film for the track was that the crinkling sounds were perceived as the patter of rain-drops against the pane. The illusion can be viewed below.
