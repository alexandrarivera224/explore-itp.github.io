                        We wanted to overwhelm viewers with a sensational flash and complementing storm acoustics to simulate a ferocious storm. However, the challenge to create a realistic lighting experience is much more complex than just having lights and requires dexterity to ensure that the other elements are visible. One has to consider the colors, porosity, diffusion, ambience, and how light penetrates through the several screens (rain, opaque parchment paper, stained glass, etc.).

                        We used the brightest lights we could find, 100 W LEDs, and went through various iterations of user testing to find the right combination layers and reflectors. Our final result consisted of pointing the lights towards the rear of the window and having light reflect off of white paper. Then, the light would pass through two layers of the clear plastic rain track, black and semi-opaque shadow cut-outs, static rain drops on parchment paper, and finally through the stained-glass window. The combined effect is the illusion of depth and obscurity of the point light sources.

                        The other trick was aligning the sounds of thunder to the pattern of lightning. Our initial set-up was for the lights to flicker once and the thunder to roll in after 2-4 seconds to simulate the accurate delay between lightning and thunder. However, through many iterations of user testing, we learned that users preferred the lightning and thunder to be very closely aligned in time and and multiple, rapid lightning flashes. Thus, we applied a high-pass filter on the thunder spectrograms to create appropriate lightning "bolts".
